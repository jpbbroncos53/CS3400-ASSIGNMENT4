CS3400-ASSIGNMENT4
==================
Assignment 4 is to investigate UI design for various size devices.
This is sometimes called "responsive" design.

You have 2 weeks (from Wendsday) to produce a web based solution
that allows a user to order pizza from a pizzaria. The application
should work on cell phones, tablets and laptops/desktops. No backend
is required.

You only have to support pizzas and drinks. pick-up or delivery

You will also be asked to evaluate the web apps for local pizza places<br>
(Kalamazoo area)...<br>
Dominos<br>
Erbelli's<br>
Bilbos<br>
Papa John's<br>
Little Caesar's<br>
Jaspare's<br>
Bimbo's<br>
Jet's<br>
Mancino's<br>

You should:<br>
1) Investigate recommendations for "responsive" design<br>
2) Look for a framework that might help support responisve design<br>
3) Produce simple use cases<br>
4) Define device support needed<br>
5) Do paper design<br>
6) Implement it - show it working as though there was a back end<br>
Unimplemented feaures may be "pinked out"<br>

To evaluate the sites you should produce a rubric and then<br>
use it to rate each site. Your rubric should have at leasst 10<br>
major items that can be scored "objectively".<br>

Your url for the assignment should be a page with links to:<br>
1) Any recomendations on support for various size devices you found useful<br>
2) A list of any frameworks you found that might be useful<br>
3) Your use cases and device support requirements<br>
4) Your implementation<br>
5) Your rubric and filled out rubrics for the sites above.<br>

Assigmnetn 4 is due December 2<br>
