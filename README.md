# CS3400-ASSIGNMENT4 #

______________________

Assignment 4 is to investigate UI design for various size devices. This is sometimes called "responsive" design.

You have 2 weeks (from Wendsday) to produce a web based solution that allows a user to order pizza from a pizzaria. The application should work on cell phones, tablets and laptops/desktops. No backend is required.

You only have to support pizzas and drinks, pick-up or delivery.

You will also be asked to evaluate the web apps for local pizza places (Kalamazoo area)...

* Dominos
* Erbelli's
* Bilbos
* Papa John's
* Little Caesar's
* Jaspare's
* Bimbo's
* Jet's
* Mancino's

You should:

1. Investigate recommendations for "responsive" design
2. Look for a framework that might help support responisve design
3. Produce simple use cases
4. Define device support needed
5. Do paper design
6. Implement it - show it working as though there was a back end, unimplemented feaures may be "pinked out"

To evaluate the sites you should produce a rubric and then use it to rate each site. Your rubric should have at leasst 10 major items that can be scored "objectively".

Your url for the assignment should be a page with links to:

1. Any recomendations on support for various size devices you found useful
2. A list of any frameworks you found that might be useful
3. Your use cases and device support requirements
4. Your implementation
5. Your rubric and filled out rubrics for the sites above.
